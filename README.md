Rootkit for use with PenPi

# PenPi
The Penpi device is a Raspberry Pi Zero W that can be used to launch HID emulation attacks as well as a multitude of others. It can be interfaced in many ways, including by app over Bluetooth and wirelessly with SSH, and can launch payloads in many ways as well. I used it for a simple HID attack in which I emulated a keyboard via USB.

# Encoder
The encoder included in the files above is designed to take scripts that are traditionally meant to run in the USB Rubber Ducky from Hak5 and enable their use on the PenPi device
